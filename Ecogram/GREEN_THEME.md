# EcoMatrix Green Theme Implementation

## Theme Changes
1. Modified `constants/Colors.ts` to use a green color palette
2. Updated `hooks/useColorScheme.ts` and `useColorScheme.web.ts` to always return 'light' 
3. Modified `hooks/useThemeColor.ts` to use only light theme colors
4. Updated `app/_layout.tsx` with a custom green EcoMatrix theme
5. Modified `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` for green tab styling

## Component Changes
1. Created a new `GreenScreenWrapper` component for consistent theming
2. Updated `TabBarBackground` components to use light theme with green accents
3. Enhanced `IconSymbol` component with additional green-themed icons
4. Updated `ThemedText` component to use green for links

## Screen Redesigns
1. Updated Home screen with eco-focused content and green styling
2. Created a Leaderboard screen with environmental conservation theme
3. Designed a Photo screen for reporting environmental issues
4. Developed a Profile screen to track environmental impact

## Styling Approach
- Used a consistent color palette with `#4CAF50` as primary green
- Applied white backgrounds with green accents
- Used light gray (`#F5F5F5`) for cards and input elements
- Maintained consistent spacing and typography across all screens

## Navigation
- Preserved the tab-based navigation structure
- Updated tab icons to match environmental theme
- Ensured consistent green color for active tabs

This implementation maintains a clean, modern UI while emphasizing the environmental focus of the EcoMatrix application with a consistent green and white theme.
