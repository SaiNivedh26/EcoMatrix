- EcoGram Bharat is an innovative platform developed by Team EcoMatrix for the ICSRF 2025 Hackathon final round.
- Designed to tackle rural waste management challenges in India, it transforms waste into valuable resources through AI-driven insights, community sharing, and gamification. Like a community hub that turns trash into treasureâ€”similar to how apps like OLX connect buyers and sellers but tailored for sustainabilityâ€”EcoGram Bharat empowers users to identify, reuse, and share materials effortlessly.
- While focused on rural areas, the system is adaptable for urban settings, making it versatile for any city or village.

## What It Does ??
<br>

EcoGram Bharat addresses waste management by integrating AI, mapping, and accessible interfaces, drawing inspiration from real-world tools like recycling apps and community marketplaces:

1. AI Material Identification: Snap a photo to identify waste types and get DIY reuse suggestions using vision models like LLaVA and Gemini.
2. Geo-Mapping for Resources: Real-time interactive maps (via Google Maps SDK) to locate and share materials, report garbage dumps, and optimize collection routes.
3. Gamification and Rewards: Earn points for eco-friendly actions, redeemable for subsidies, discounts, or welfare priorities to boost participation.
4. Voice Agent for Inclusivity: A Sarvam AI-powered multi-lingual voice agent allows users, especially the elderly or those without smartphones, to call a number for insights on nearby materials, garbage reporting, or leaderboard updatesâ€”ensuring accessibility without tech barriers.
5. Community Resource Sharing: Connect users for trading or sharing waste-derived resources like compost or upcycled items.
6. Government Data Insights: Conversational access to waste trends and impacts via integrated datasets.



## Voice Interaction (Core Idea)

Users can dial a Twilio-allocated number to interact with the voice agent, which provides multi-lingual guidance on material reuse, nearby resources, or reporting issues.
In the app, use voice commands for hands-free operation.

## Configuration
EcoGram Bharat is configured for rural India but can be adapted to any location by updating geo-bounds and datasets in the backend. It supports multiple Indian languages via Sarvam.ai, frontier Indian Model service provider and integrates with government APIs for real-time data.
